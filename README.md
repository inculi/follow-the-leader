Welcome to the latest installment of Robert and James' journey to hacking the system. In this episode, we shall attempt to gain the upper-edge for our school marketwatch game.  

In order to achieve this, we had a few ideas. Our first idea was to hope that there would be some sort of lag betwene the actual stock market prices and times and MarketWatch prices/times. Alas, that lag does not exist.  

Luckily, our brains were able to come up with more than one idea. With hundreds of public games, most of which have public transaction information for each player, there is enough data to be able to rank the players based off of their performance. Because we wish to strive to be the best players, it only follows that it would be fairly prudent to follow the moves of the **best** players.  

This program allows users to combine the best strategies of the best players on the MarketWatch site in order for us to become the best.
